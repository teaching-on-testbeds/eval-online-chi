# Online evaluation of ML systems

In this tutorial, we will practice selected techniques for evaluating machine learning systems, and then monitoring them in production. It is one of a 3-part series:

* [Offline evaluation of ML systems](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/eval-offline-chi/)
* **Online evaluation of ML systems** (this part!)
* [Evaluation of ML systems by closing the feedback loop](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/eval-loop-chi/)

In this particular section, we will practice evaluation and monitoring in the *online* stage - when a system is serving some or all real users.

Follow along at [Online evaluation of ML systems](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/eval-online-chi/).

This tutorial uses: one `m1.medium` VM at KVM@TACC, and one floating IP.
